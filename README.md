# AlchemyGame
	This program allows one user to play the game of Alchemy. Through a 
	graphical user interface, the player is able to click on the board to place
	runes which turn the tile beneath it to gold. The goal of the game is to 
	turn the entire board gold by placing runes which are randomly chosen. Runes
	can only be placed beside another rune of the same colour and/or shape. When 
	a row or column is filled with runes then those runes are removed allowing 
	more runes to be placed on those tiles. The player has to be strategic in 
	where they place runes because not being able to place runes and discarding 
	more than 3 times leads to a loss.
