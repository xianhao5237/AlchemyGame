Instructions

Your task is to place runes on the board to turn the tiles underneath to gold. 
To win you must turn the entire board into gold. 

Runes can only be placed on empty tiles (brown or gold) and they must be placed 
beside an existing rune. However they can only be placed beside runes with the 
same colour and/or shape. If placing it between multiple other runes it must have
the same colour and/or shape with each one.

Discard Pile
Runes are randomly chosen every turn from 26 different ones. If you can't place 
that specific rune you can press the discard button to add it to the discard pile
and another random rune will appear. However there is only space for three runes.
After it is full placing another rune in the discard pile will be game over. But,
after placing a rune, a spot from the discard pile is cleared. 

Block Runes
Blocks can be placed beside any rune(s) and any rune can be place beside existing
block tiles. However, these still have to be connected to  an existing rune when 
placing it. 

Destroying Runes
If a row or column is filled up with runes, then those runes will be destroyed
leaving the gold tile underneath making room for other runes to be placed. 

Use the reset button at the bottom to clear the board and play again.
For more detailed instructions with examples please refer to the User Manual.
